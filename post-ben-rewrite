Brushstroke.
Stroke is one object type (no inheritance malarkey) - can have a backstroke flag though.
Stroke does not resolve until needed - in the painting.
Strokes have brush and paint assignments - either single or mapped.

Ramp in and out can have many points, generated by function power. There is no lift attribute. Internally, we always make curves. the case of a curve, the ramp in and out must be over the curve.


Painting
No filtering or sorting in the painting. Painting is for projection and drawing.
